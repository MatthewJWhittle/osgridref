# osgridref
# Overview
Spatial data is often store as [Ordinance Survey National Grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordnance_Survey_National_Grid) references. This is an easy way to recorded spatial data in the field but isn't straight forward to convert to coordinates. The goalof the `osgridref` package is to provide a functions to easily convert grid references to eastings and northings (EPSG:27700) and back again.

# Installation
The package can currently be installed from github:
```{r eval=FALSE}
# Install the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("matthewjwhittle/osgridref")
```




# Examples
```{r setup, message = FALSE}
library(osgridref)

grid_refs <- c("TA 304 403", "SE 2344 0533", "SE13", "SE 23444 05334")
# Returns a tibble of X and Y coords and their resolution
gridref_to_xy(grid_refs)
```
